# zmsharedgal

This utility will allow you to setup a shared GAL between the domains you choose. Please note, when you enter the domains, these domains will all share between each other, so all users on any domain will see all users on the other domains you have shared the GAL between.

### MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR LDAP PASSWORD AND HOSTNAME!

You can get that information with this command: `zmlocalconfig -s |egrep \"ldap_root_password|ldap_url\"`
